Hmmm...\r\n\r\n## Using\r\n\r\nSimple example of defining and cailling a function:\r\n\r\n```clojure\r\n(ns examples.basic)\r\n\r\n(defn double [x]\r\n    (* 2 x))\r\n\r\n(println (str \"Double 2 is... \" (double 2)))\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can compile and run this with:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./bin/cljp examples/basic.cljp\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich should output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDouble 2 is... 4\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\nAt the moment only the basic of Clojure have been implemented, but hopefully this will be a growing list.\r\n\r\n* defn\r\n* namespaces (with :use and :require)\r\n* PHP integration\r\n\r\n## PHP Integration\r\n\r\nIntegration with PHP is handled (like in ClojureScript) through the *php* import to each namespace.  You\r\ncan then reference any functions from the standard PHP distributions.\r\n\r\n```clojure\r\n(println \"Date is: \" (php/date \"dS F Y, H:i:s\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nTests written with Midje and PHPUnit, run them with...\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nlein midje\r\nphpunit test/php\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Disclaimer\r\n\r\nThis is not meant to ever be an actually useful thing, compiling Clojure to PHP is insane.  It's just\r\na learning tool for me to get more familiar with Clojure.\r\n","tagline":"Naive experiment turning Clojure to PHP","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
